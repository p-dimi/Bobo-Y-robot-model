# Bobo Y
My Bobo Y robot, with cura project files for each part, the AI code, and the specs of which parts were used and links where such parts can be purchased.


The project is Open Source - you are welcome to use the code and models however you like.

The pinout can be inferred from reading the code. The assembly is fairly intuitive and not too complicated.

No additional instructions will be provided based on the fact that I am no longer working on this project (as it is complete) and have not created a manual for it.

Some parts may not be 100% up to measure and might have very minor inaccuracies. The original models took a long time to 3D print, and after initial assembly - whatever minor flaws were detected were not repaired due to the sheer amount of time re-printing would take.

The video demonstration below shows the model as is - all the parts are exactly as you would print them.
